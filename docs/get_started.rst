Installation
------------

Linux / OS X
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run ``npm install discord.js --save`` in your project's directory and you should be good to go!

Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unfortunately, the Windows installation process is a little more lengthy. You need to have `Visual Studio Express`_ (or any of the other distributions of it). This is necessary for build tools for the WebSocket dependency.

After you have obtained these tools, you need to run ``npm install discord.js --save --msvs_version=2015`` in your working directory. Hopefully this should all go well!
